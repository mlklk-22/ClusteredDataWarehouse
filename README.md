# Clustered Data Warehouse

Stack: Spring Boot, Java 8, Hibernate, MySQL


 Suppose you are part of a scrum team developing data warehouse for Bloomberg to analyze FX deals. One of customer stories is to accept deals details from and persist them into DB.


Request logic as following:

* Request Fields(Deal Unique Id, From Currency ISO Code "Ordering Currency", To Currency ISO Code, Deal timestamp, Deal Amount in ordering currency).
* Validate row structure.(e.g: Missing fields, Type format..etc. We do not expect you to cover all possible cases but we'll look to how you'll implement validations)
* System should not import same request twice.
* No rollback allowed, what every rows imported should be saved in DB.


Deliverables Work :

* For DB type, you can select between (MySql or MongoDB)
* Workable deployment including sample file (Docker Compose).
* Maven or Gradle project is required for full source code.
* Proper error/exception handling.
* Proper Logging.
* Proper unit testing with respected Coverage.
* Delivered over Githhub.com.
* Makefile to streamline running application (plus).
